# Project Proposal

### Project title

rendezvous

### What and why?

We propose building a social planning app that helps groups of friends easily decide what to do when they hang out. Right now, many groups rely on messy group chats with endless "we should do this!", scattered TikTok/Instagram saves, and long indecisive discussions. This often wastes time and results in people falling back on the same few, familiar options.

Our system will solve this by creating a shared, centralized bucket list where friends can add cafes, restaurants, activities, and experiences they discover online. When the group wants to go out, they can filter by category (e.g., “dinner,” “outdoors,” “budget-friendly”) and use a playful mechanic (spin a wheel, draw a card, etc.) to randomly generate a plan.

This is important because it reduces decision fatigue, encourages trying new places, and makes social outings smoother and more fun.

### For whom?

The software is designed for university students and young adults who often plan outings with friends and are always looking for new things to try. Our initial target users will be other NYU students (including ourselves and our classmates), since we all regularly organize group hangouts, explore the city, and already share TikTok/Instagram links of places to visit.

By focusing on this audience, we can gather real feedback quickly and ensure the app addresses actual pain points in their social planning process.

### How? 

From an end-user’s perspective, the system will allow them to:  

- **Add items to the shared list**: Friends can add cafes, restaurants, or activities they’ve saved from TikTok, Instagram, or other sources.  

- **AI-powered info extraction**: When a link or video is added, the app uses AI to automatically extract key details (e.g., restaurant name, location, cost, activity type, opening hours). The user will be able to edit these fields if they are incorrect or to adjust them to their preferences.

- **Filter & choose outings**: When planning, the group opens the app, applies filters (budget, vibe, time of day, weather, activity type), and generates a shortlist.  

- **Randomize the choice**: The app provides a fun “decision tool” (wheel spin or card draw) that picks the outing to avoid long debates.  

- **Track completed outings & memories**: Items can be marked as “done,” moving them into a shared memory list. Friends can upload photos, captions, and reflections for each completed outing, turning the list into a digital scrapbook of the group’s adventures.  

### Scope

This project is ambitious but manageable for a group of 4–6 programmers in one semester:  

- **Database design**: A system for storing shared lists, filters, and user-generated content.  
- **Front-end development**: A clean, social-friendly interface that is intuitive for group use.  
- **AI integration**: Extracting key details from TikTok/Instagram posts to reduce manual input.   

We believe this scope is achievable because it combines standard features (list management, filters, database) with few creative elements!
